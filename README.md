<b>Project Overview:</b>
The QR-Based Box Parking Management System is a web interface designed to solve the common issue of blocked parking, specifically in scenarios known as "box parking." Box parking occurs when a vehicle is parked in a way that blocks other vehicles from exiting their parking space, creating significant inconvenience for other drivers.

How It Works:

User Registration:

Vehicle owners must first register on our portal. The registration process involves creating an account by providing essential details such as the vehicle registration number, contact information, and any other required personal information.
After successful registration, the system generates a unique QR code for each user, linked to their vehicle's registration number.

QR Code Generation and Application:

The generated QR code must be printed and affixed to the vehicle in a visible location, such as the windshield or rear window. This QR code serves as a digital identifier for the vehicle, making it easy for others to contact the owner if the vehicle is blocking access.

Blocked Vehicle Scenario:

If a user's vehicle is blocked by another vehicle, they can scan the QR code on the blocking vehicle using their smartphone.
Upon scanning, they are redirected to a user-friendly interface that offers predefined options to send a message or place a call to the vehicle owner. The message and call options are predefined to ensure clarity and consistency in communication, making the process quick and straightforward.
